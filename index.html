                Mediation and collaboration Station</h2>
            <p>At the Law Station, we have developed a reputation for effective legal representation in various areas of practice and mediation in St. Johns County and surrounding counties. Owner and founder Melissa Sarris Kauttu has years been an attorney for 30 years, actively working with clients from all walks of life, including those of high net worth and those struggling with various work, personal and family issues. Her diverse experience gives her a unique perspective into the dynamics of problem solving and she is one of a very small number of attorneys who have been trained in the collaborative law process. She has taken this experience out of the courtroom and into the mediation setting as she also serves as an independent mediator, settling many different kinds of cases between famillies, businesses and individuals. </p>
