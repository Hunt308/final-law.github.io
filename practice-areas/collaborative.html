            <h2>What is collaborative law?</h2>
            <p>In the divorce context, many couples wish to make agreements outside of court, but have issues resolving their differences
                without assistance. They may have differing views on how best to settle issues like child custody, support, and property division. However, they could settle their differences if they had: (1) enough information to understand the issues of their divorce; (2) enough information on how their unique facts will be governed should they not come to agreement; and (3) a structure to help facilitate a settlement based on (1) and (2). These couples may benefit from the collaborative process. </p>
            <p>The collabortive process is a “troubleshooting and problem solving” process. It is intended to remove disputes from the court so the parties are not at odds going forward. Again, it can be used in any litigation setting, but is often used in family law.   </p>
            <p>Melissa Sarris Kauttu is one of the few attorneys in North Florida who has been trained in the collaborative process. Unlike her job as a mediator, in Collaborative Law she serves as an attorney for one party and the opposing party often retains their own attorney who is willing to collaborate. Any necessary helpers/facilitators, such as tax advisors, counselors, appraisers, etc., are added in as needed to help facilitate a workable resolution. </p>
