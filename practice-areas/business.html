            <h2>Business</h2>
            <p>The Law Station can help you decide what type of business entity to form and can consult your tax advisor who will assist you in making any tax elections. She will file your Articles and draft your Bylaws and Operating Agreements, as needed, and any needed amendments. The Law Station can also assist you with corporate maintenance, drafting and review of business contracts and can be on hand for ongoing business consulting. </p>
            <h2>Probate</h2>
            <p>The Law Station will walk you through the steps to administer your loved one’s estate. We will evaluate what type of probate proceeding is warranted based upon the size of the estate. If a full probate is required, The Law Station will get you appointed as personal representative and guide you through the marshaling and inventorying of assets. We can help you deal with creditor’s claims and assist you in the distribution of the estate. If your loved one’s estate can be adminstered in a summary or other shortened proceeding, as opposed to a full administration, we will find the appropriate vehicle to help you clear title to the decedent’s property. At all times, we will be mindful of your loss and we will work diligently to make the transition as easy as possible for you and your family. </p>
            <h2>Estate Planning</h2>
            <p>The Law Station will analyze your assets and how title is held to help you tailor an estate plan especially designed for you and your family. Estate planning can include wills, simple and more complex trusts,  durable powers of attorney, and living wills and designations of health care surrogates, among other legal instruments that are available for incapacity and testamentary (at death) planning. </p>
